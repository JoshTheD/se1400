            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>I will get most of my content from my existing shopify page which already has my products and

            <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>

            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>

                start pushing toward this goal</p>
            <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>my main goal is to get orders, but I would also like this page to gather information about what they
                want, for example, what color and shape they want the print to be</p>
            <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>the main goal of this site is to gather orders from customers and relay any extra information back to me
