            <h4>Who is the competition?</h4>
            <p>the main competition would be online retail stores like shopify and square space. these providers offer
                prebuilt websites that only work.</p>
            <h4>What do I do about this?</h4>
            <p>my goal is to keep the simplicity and easy use of the site while making it look nice and have smooth
                animation.</p>
            <h4>What is the competition doing right?</h4>
            <p>In my opinion, shopify does a super good job at keeping things simple. for example, everything in the
                page is split into blocks and has a super simple navigation feature</p>
            <h4>What is the competition doing wrong?</h4>
            <p>I feel that the flaw with shopify and square space is that everyone uses the same page. You can only have
                so many copies of "dusk" before it becomes repetitive.</p>
